# The "Hello World" demo how to change a digital port synchronously.
#
# Warning: this is just an example of how to accesss the digital ports.
# For precise timing please use timers or callback handlers
# and not the sleep() command which locks up processing
# and is not precise.

# On Windows: \\.\COM1, \\.\COM2
